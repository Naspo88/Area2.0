# Area2.0
The project's objective is to be able to offer companies and users a simple service for the creation and use of local dynamic maps, in which the use of navigation through the GPS is not accurate or not available, as for example in enclosed spaces. The initial idea is to use a two-dimensional map that represents the area on which you want create the navigation service. Local administrators and users will use this map in different ways through two interfaces.

All the tools needed to create the navigation service can be found in the administration interface. The reference structure is a graph, and through this interface you can create one on the reference map, so that each node represents a point of interest (or critical) of the local, while each link represents the path that you can make from a node to another. The interface is automated, for nodes is only needed to enter a label of recognition and possibly the notes, for links is enough to indicate which of the two nodes connect and all the necessary data will be calculated by the program. You can input some note too.

The user interface is the one that uses everything that has been created on the map to navigate in the local. Using Dijkstra's algorithm is calculated the shortest path between two points selected by the user and it provides the route instructions.
